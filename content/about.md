# Our Story

A dusty floor fan, 4 Cambodians and myself shared two bucket seats in the middle row of a minivan. Perched on half a seat with my head plastered against the window rattling down the unpaved highway between Prey Veng and Phnom Penh the woman next to me was startled by my presence on the bus because by many measures, we were worlds apart. A single mother of two, Vwie (ហួរ ឆៃលៀហ) was a cambodian migrant factory worker in her mid thirties supporting her children and her ailing mother on a mere $200 a month. I was solidly middle class, educated, white male with no dependents and three year contract for an NGO in her hometown. Yet, here we were sharing seat and stories about our lives.

Soon I began to learn about her life at a clothing factory in Phnom Penh. She works on an assembly line with 30 other women completing a single seam producing expensive clothes for American consumers. She is from Prey Veng, but left the countryside and her two small children to work in the city seeing her children once a month if she’s lucky. Her husband left her for a younger, more beautiful woman. They now live with her mother who who she was the older woman next to her. She had made this rare trip to Prey Veng to accompany her children and mother to Phnom Penh for her mother could get medical care.

As if on cue her mother started vomiting silently into a small black plastic bag. Her daughter on her lap started to dry heave. I offered her my water bottle to rinse her mouth as Vwie continued, “I wish that I had money to send them to school so they could learn english, but I don’t have money. I wish I could pay back the loan I took out to pay for my mother's hospital bills. I wish I could start a small business to sell food and clothes on the side of the road.” She doesn’t need a handout. She needs an opportunity.

I jotted down her contact information, because once we get this project running, she is exactly the type of person that Decent Clothes will. Decent Clothes is a small project, but we have big dreams. Simply put, we want to work with tailors like Vwie and connect them directly to you cutting out as many executives, factory owners, and steps in the supply chain as we can. She deserves the chance to be paid a fair wage to produce quality clothes. Can Decent Clothes make that happen?

If you want to support decent clothes made by decent people at a decent price. Join our movement.
